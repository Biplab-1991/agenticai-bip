        f"You **You should not exclude any single word from the content which you have received from doc_input**.\n"
        f"1.  **Headings:** Use `h2.` for primary section titles (e.g., 'Check Azure Health') and `h3.` for sub-sections.\n"
        f"2.  **Bulleted Points:** Use a hash symbol (`#`) for main list items and a dash (`-`) for sub-items. For nested items, repeat the symbol, e.g., `#` for a top-level list, `##` for a nested list, or `-` for a bullet, `--` for a nested bullet.\n"
        f"3.  **Bold Text:** Wrap bold text in asterisks (`*`)\n"
        f"4.  **Code Blocks:** Wrap all code snippets in `{{code}}` and `{{/code}}` tags.\n"
        f"5.  **Links:** Format all URLs as `[text|URL]`.\n"
        f"6.  **Do NOT include any titles, headers, or footers.** The output should be a single, clean block of formatted wiki-markup starting directly with the first heading or list item.\n\n"
