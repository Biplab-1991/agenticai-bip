Cloud Run Deployment Models for LangGraph-Based Agent Systems

This document outlines three architectural options for deploying LangGraph-based agent systems on Google Cloud Run, highlighting trade-offs, best-fit use cases, and practical setups.

Option 1: One Cloud Run Service, One Endpoint

Overview:

Deploy a single application (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask).

The supervisor agent handles incoming HTTP requests.

All sub-agents are defined internally and invoked as in-process functions.

Architecture:

Client --> [ Cloud Run Service ] --> Supervisor --> Sub-Agents (in-memory calls)

Characteristics:

Only one public endpoint (e.g., /supervisor).

No external access to sub-agents.

Fast and simple communication via Python function calls.

Best For:

Centralized systems

Lower operational overhead

Early-stage prototypes

Cost-sensitive deployments

Option 2: Multiple Cloud Run Services (One per Agent)

Overview:

Each agent (supervisor + sub-agents) is deployed as a separate Cloud Run service.

Communication between supervisor and sub-agents occurs over HTTP.

Architecture:

Client --> [ Supervisor Service ] --> HTTP --> [ Sub-Agent 1 Service ]
                                       --> HTTP --> [ Sub-Agent 2 Service ]
                                       --> HTTP --> [ Sub-Agent N Service ]

Characteristics:

Each service has its own endpoint.

Agents operate independently and can be scaled individually.

More complex DevOps and networking setup.

Best For:

Microservice architectures

Need for individual scaling, observability, or fault isolation

Shared agents across multiple systems

Hybrid Option: One Cloud Run Service, Internal Routes

Overview:

Deploy one FastAPI/Flask app with multiple routes.

Supervisor agent is the default route.

Each sub-agent is exposed via a separate internal route (e.g., /cloud_ops, /sysadmin).

Architecture:

Client --> [ Cloud Run Service ]
             |-- /supervisor --> Supervisor logic --> Internal call to sub-agent
             |-- /cloud_ops  --> Direct to sub-agent
             |-- /sysadmin   --> Direct to sub-agent

Characteristics:

One deployed service with multiple logical endpoints.

Sub-agents are accessible for testing, debugging, or internal reuse.

Maintains centralized control while allowing modular access.

Best For:

Centralized logic with partial modularity

Teams wanting easy testing or debugging of sub-agents

Smooth transition to microservices later

Each approach has trade-offs in terms of scalability, complexity, and development speed. Choose based on your system needs and how independently each agent must operate.
