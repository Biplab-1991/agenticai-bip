content='Here\'s a breakdown of troubleshooting steps you can take using the AWS CLI to diagnose why you can\'t access your EC2 instance `i-xxxxxx` in `us-east-1`, based on the provided documentation:\n\n*   **Check Instance Status via AWS CLI:**\n\n    *   Use the following command to check the current status of your instance.  Make sure you run this command from a server located in the same AWS account and region (`us-east-1` in your case) as the instance you are troubleshooting.\n    *   ```bash\n        aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1 --instance-ids i-xxxxxx\n        ```\n    *   This command will return detailed information about the instance, including its current state (e.g., `running`, `stopped`, `terminated`).  Pay close attention to the `State` field in the output.\n    *   If the instance is in a `stopped` state, proceed to the next step to start it. If it\'s in a `terminated` state, the instance no longer exists, and you\'ll need to create a new one.\n\n*   **Start the Instance via AWS CLI (if stopped):**\n\n    *   If the instance status is `stopped`, use the following command to start it:\n    *   ```bash\n        aws ec2 start-instances --region us-east-1 --instance-ids i-xxxxxx\n        ```\n    *   After running this command, the instance will transition to the `pending` state and then, hopefully, to the `running` state.  You can use the `describe-instances` command again to monitor the status change.\n\n*   **Check Security Group Configuration:**\n\n    *   The documentation mentions that a "Network error: Connection refused" message can indicate a security group issue. Use the following command to describe the security groups associated with your instance:\n    *   ```bash\n        aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1 --instance-ids i-xxxxxx --query \'Reservations[*].Instances[*].SecurityGroups[*].GroupName\' --output text\n        ```\n    *   This command will list the names of the security groups associated with your instance.  You\'ll need to examine these security groups to ensure they allow inbound SSH traffic (port 22) from your IP address or CIDR range.\n    *   To examine a specific security group, use:\n        ```bash\n        aws ec2 describe-security-groups --region us-east-1 --group-names <security_group_name>\n        ```\n        Replace `<security_group_name>` with the actual name of the security group.  Look for inbound rules that allow traffic on port 22 (SSH).\n\n*   **Check for Netgroup Membership Issues (If "Authentication failed"):**\n\n    *   If you are receiving an "Authentication failed" message, the problem might be related to Netgroup membership. Unfortunately, the provided documentation doesn\'t offer a direct AWS CLI command to check Netgroup membership.  You\'ll likely need to use the "SwissKnife Tool" (mentioned in the documentation) to determine the Netgroups associated with the server and verify your VZID\'s membership. Since you prefer API calls, you might need to explore if the SwissKnife Tool exposes any APIs for this purpose.  If not, you might need to log into another instance within Verizon\'s environment that has access to the SwissKnife Tool and run commands from there.\n\n*   **Verify SSH Daemon (sshd) is Running (Less Likely with Previous Functionality):**\n\n    *   While less likely since the instance was previously working, the SSH daemon might have stopped. The documentation suggests using the "VZ Run Command" Jenkins plugin to check this.  Since you prefer API calls, you\'d need to investigate if the Jenkins plugin exposes an API to execute remote commands.  If so, you could use that API to run a command like `systemctl status sshd` on the instance. Alternatively, AWS Systems Manager (SSM) could be used if the instance has the SSM agent running and is properly configured.\n\n*   **Check AWS Subnet Definition:**\n\n    *   The documentation indicates that a "Network error: Connection refused" message appearing after 15-30 seconds could point to a subnet issue. While the documentation does not provide a direct AWS CLI command to troubleshoot this, you can use the following commands to investigate the subnet and associated network ACLs:\n    *   First, get the subnet ID associated with the instance:\n        ```bash\n        aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1 --instance-ids i-xxxxxx --query \'Reservations[*].Instances[*].SubnetId\' --output text\n        ```\n    *
