I wanted to bring to your attention that Akshay’s last working day is currently set for 17th August 2025. He has been a valuable asset to our team, consistently delivering high-quality work and demonstrating strong ownership in his responsibilities.

Given his contributions and the critical nature of his role, I would like to understand if there is any plan in place to retain him. If not, I’d appreciate guidance on whether we can initiate a discussion around possible retention options or if a counter-offer strategy is being considered.

Looking forward to your inputs.
