Subject: Urgent: Retention Plan for Akshay (Key Resource on Agentic AI Project)

Dear [Manager's Name] / Leadership Team,

I hope you are doing well.

This is to bring to your attention that Akshay, a key member of our team currently working on the Agentic AI project, is scheduled to have his last working day on 17th August 2025.

Given the complexity and criticality of the ongoing work—and Akshay’s deep involvement and domain understanding—I am concerned about the potential disruption this may cause to project continuity and deliverables.

I would like to understand if there is any retention plan in consideration, or if we can explore the possibility of engaging with him further to ensure a smooth transition or even continued involvement.

Looking forward to your direction on this matter.

Best regards,
Biplab Dey
