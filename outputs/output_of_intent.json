  "documentation": [
    "1.  **Set up your Python Environment:**",
    "* Ensure Python 3.x is installed.",
    "* Install `pip` (Python package installer).",
    "* (Recommended) Install the `gcloud CLI` for easier authentication and verification.",
    "2.  **Install the Google Cloud Compute Client Library:**",
    "* Open your terminal or command prompt and run: `pip install google-cloud-compute`",
    "3.  **Configure Authentication for your Python Script:**",
    "* **For Production/Service Accounts:**",
    "* Create a Google Cloud Service Account in your GCP project.",
    "* Grant it the necessary IAM role (e.g., `Compute Instance Admin (v1)` or a custom role with `compute.instances.start` permission).",
    "* Generate and download the JSON key file for the service account.",
    "* Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of this JSON key file before running your script.",
    "* **For Local Development (User Credentials):**",
    "* Authenticate your `gcloud CLI` by running: `gcloud auth application-default login`",
    "* This will create application default credentials that your Python script can automatically use.",
    "4.  **Identify the Target VM Details:**",
    "* Note down your **Google Cloud Project ID**.",
    "* Note down the **Zone** where your VM instance resides (e.g., `us-central1-a`).",
    "* Note down the exact **Instance Name** of the VM you wish to start.",
    "5.  **Verify IAM Permissions:**",
    "* Confirm that the authenticated identity (service account or user) has the `compute.instances.start` permission for the specific VM instance or at the project level. The `Compute Instance Admin (v1)` role includes this permission.",
    "6.  **Write the Python Script to Start the VM:**",
    "* Import the `compute_v1` client library.",
    "* Initialize the `InstancesClient`.",
    "* Call the `start` method, providing your `project_id`, `zone`, and `instance_name`.",
    "* Poll the returned operation object to wait for the VM start process to complete.",
    "7.  **Execute the Python Script:**",
    "* Run your Python script from your terminal.",
    "8.  **Verify the VM Status:**",
    "* Check the Google Cloud Console (Compute Engine -> VM instances) to see if the VM's status is \"Running.\"",
    "* Alternatively, use the `gcloud CLI`: `gcloud compute instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] --zone=[ZONE]` and check the `status` field.",
    "9.  **Troubleshoot Common Issues (if VM doesn't start):**",
    "* **Authentication Errors:** Ensure `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set correctly or `gcloud auth application-default login` was successful.",
    "* **Permission Denied:** Double-check IAM roles (step 5). The error message usually indicates the missing permission.",
    "* **Incorrect VM Details:** Verify that the `project_id`, `zone`, and `instance_name` in your script exactly match your GCP resources.",
    "* **VM Already Running/Stopped:** If the VM is already running, the API call might not change its state. If it's in a transient state (e.g., `STOPPING`), wait for it to reach a stable state (`TERMINATED` or `RUNNING`) before attempting to start it.",
    "* **API Quota Exceeded:** While less common for a single VM start, check your project's API quotas in the GCP Console if you're making many requests.",
    "* **Network/Connectivity:** Ensure your local environment has network access to Google Cloud APIs."
