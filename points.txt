Use a WebSocket Server as a central communication channel between the React UI and the Long-Running API.

The React UI sends a request (with session ID) to the WebSocket server, which triggers a fire-and-forget call to the long-running API.

The Long-Running API emits live progress updates (step-by-step status) and finally sends the result back to the WebSocket server.

The WebSocket server pushes these updates in real time to the React UI, ensuring the user always sees current execution status.
